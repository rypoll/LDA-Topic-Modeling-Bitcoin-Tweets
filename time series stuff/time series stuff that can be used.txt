ice_cream_heater_df = ice_cream_heater_df[['ice cream', 'heater']]
model = VAR(ice_cream_heater_df)
model_fit = model.fit(maxlags=13)
model_fit.summary()

- the data is in each paper
- the url is associated with the data 
- data will have 20k genes
- columns are the cells
- the columns are different, so these are different
- in public domaine there is 100million cells
- the idea is to use all 100 million cells
- the idea is to run the model algoritm on different subsets of cells, need to find the cells 
- we need to catologue the data 
- tdm is to summarise the document, its a cool feature
- get gene ranking, talk about this gene
